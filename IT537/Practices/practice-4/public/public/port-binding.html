<h1>Port Binding</h1>

<p>
  A twelve-factor app is completely self-contained and does not rely on the
  runtime injection of a webserver into the execution environment.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Self-Contained Services:</strong> The web app exports HTTP as a
    service by binding to a port and listening for incoming requests. It
    "becomes" the server itself.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Protocol Agnostic:</strong> While HTTP is the most common, any
    service (like Redis or an XMPP server) can be exported via port binding. In
    development, the app is accessed via a URL like
    <code>http://localhost:5000/</code>.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Composition:</strong> Port binding means that one app can become the
    backing service for another app by providing the URL to the consumer app in
    its configuration.
  </li>
</ul>
