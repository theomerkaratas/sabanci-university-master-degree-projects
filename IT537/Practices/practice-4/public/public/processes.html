<h1>Processes</h1>

<p>
  The app is executed in the execution environment as one or more stateless
  processes.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Statelessness:</strong> Twelve-factor processes are stateless and
    share-nothing. Any data that needs to persist must be stored in a stateful
    backing service, typically a database or a distributed cache like Redis.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>No Sticky Sessions:</strong> You should never assume that anything
    cached in memory or on disk will be available for a future request. Since
    there are multiple processes, a second request might be handled by a
    completely different instance.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Disposable Memory:</strong> The local file system should be treated
    as a temporary, single-transaction scratchpad. This allows the app to be
    highly scalable and easily recovered if a process crashes.
  </li>
</ul>
