<h1>Dependencies</h1>

<p>
  A twelve-factor app never relies on the implicit existence of system-wide
  packages or tools.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Explicit Declaration:</strong> You must use a dependency declaration
    manifest (such as a <code>package.json</code>,
    <code>requirements.txt</code>, or <code>Gemfile</code>) to list every
    library the app needs to function.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Isolation:</strong> Use a dependency isolation tool to ensure that
    no implicit dependencies "leak" in from the surrounding system. This
    guarantees that the app behaves the same way regardless of the machine it is
    running on.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>No System Tool Reliance:</strong> If the app needs to shell out to a
    system tool (like <code>curl</code> or <code>imagemagick</code>), that tool
    should be treated as a dependency and bundled into the app or installed via
    a controlled setup script.
  </li>
</ul>
