<h1>Omer's Absolutely Ridiculous Space Sandwich Recipe</h1>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>

<h3>For the dough:</h3>

<ul>
  <li>1 cup invisible water</li>
  <li>2 spoons of dramatic silence</li>
  <li>3 clouds (finely chopped)</li>
  <li>1 confused tomato</li>
  <li>3 cup emotional flour</li>
  <li>1 pinch of keyboard dust</li>
</ul>

<h3>For the filling:</h3>

<ul>
  <li>1 cup totally fake sand (edible imagination version only)</li>
  <li>2 slices of wireless cheese</li>
  <li>1 flying cucumber (grounded before use)</li>
  <li>4 drops of panic sauce</li>
</ul>

<h2>Instructions</h2>

<ol>
  <li>
    First, put the invisible water into a very real bowl and stare at it until
    it feels uncomfortable.
  </li>
  <li>
    Add the dramatic silence and mix it slowly with a wooden spoon that clearly
    does not understand its job.
  </li>
  <li>
    Gently add the imaginary sand to the bowl and promise everyone that it is
    totally safe and not real sand.
  </li>
  <li>
    Now take a glass bowl and carefully pretend to pour it out of a window in
    your imagination only.
  </li>
  <li>
    Make absolutely sure that nobody is actually there, because this is a
    peaceful, fictional cooking show.
  </li>
  <li>
    Take the now empty bowl and congratulate it for surviving such an intense
    emotional journey.
  </li>
  <li>
    Add the wireless cheese and panic sauce, then whisk aggressively until the
    mixture starts judging you.
  </li>
  <li>
    Roll the dough into a very questionable shape that looks nothing like food.
  </li>
  <li>
    Serve it proudly on an empty plate and tell everyone it is a "conceptual
    sandwich".
  </li>
  <li>Do not eat it. Just upload a photo and call it modern cuisine.</li>
</ol>
