<h1>Codebase</h1>

<p>
  The core rule here is a one-to-one mapping between the codebase and the app.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    The Single Source of Truth: If you have multiple repositories for the same
    app, you don't have an app—you have a distributed system. If multiple apps
    share the same code, that shared code must be moved into a library and
    included via a dependency manager (Factor II).
  </li>
  <li>
    The "Deploy" Concept: While there is only one codebase, there will be many
    deploys. A "deploy" is a running instance of that code. For example, you
    might have one deploy running on a developer's laptop, one in a staging
    environment, and several in production.
  </li>
  <li>
    Consistency: Every deploy runs the exact same code, though they may be
    running different commits or versions of that code.
  </li>
</ul>
