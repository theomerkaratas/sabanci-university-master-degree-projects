<h1>Concurrency</h1>

<p>
  Scale the application by adding more independent processes rather than making
  a single process larger.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>The Process Model:</strong> Assign different tasks to different
    process types. For example, HTTP requests are handled by a
    <code>web</code> process, while long-running background tasks are handled by
    a <code>worker</code> process.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Horizontal Scaling:</strong> Because processes are stateless and
    share-nothing (Factor VI), scaling is as simple as spinning up more copies
    of a specific process type. This allows the app to handle increased load
    effortlessly.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Individual Management:</strong> Different process types can be
    scaled independently. If you have a backlog of background jobs, you can
    scale the <code>worker</code> processes without needing to add more
    <code>web</code> processes.
  </li>
</ul>
