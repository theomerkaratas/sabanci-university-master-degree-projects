<p>Maximize robustness with fast startup and graceful shutdown.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Fast Startup:</strong> Processes should strive to minimize startup
    time. This allows for more agile release cycles and moving processes across
    hardware quickly if a failure occurs.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Graceful Shutdown:</strong> Processes should shut down cleanly when
    they receive a <code>SIGTERM</code> signal. For a web process, this means
    refusing new requests but finishing the one it is currently processing
    before exiting.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Crash Resilience:</strong> The app should be designed to handle
    unexpected, non-graceful terminations. By being stateless and using robust
    queuing systems for workers, the app remains stable even if a process dies
    suddenly.
  </li>
</ul>
