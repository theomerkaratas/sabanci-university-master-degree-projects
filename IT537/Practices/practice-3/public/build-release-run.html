<h1>Build, Release, Run</h1>

<p>
  The transformation of a codebase into a running deployment happens in three
  strictly separated stages.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>The Build Stage:</strong> This stage transforms the code into an
    executable bundle known as a build. It fetches dependencies and compiles
    binaries/assets.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>The Release Stage:</strong> This takes the build and combines it
    with the current deployment's configuration. The resulting release contains
    both the executable and the settings, ready for immediate execution.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>The Run Stage:</strong> This is where the app actually runs in the
    execution environment. This stage should be kept as simple as possible, as
    errors in the run stage cannot be easily fixed without creating a new
    release.
  </li>
</ul>
