<h1>Logs</h1>

<p>Treat logs as event streams rather than files stored on a disk.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Standard Output:</strong> The application should not concern itself
    with routing or storing its own logs. It should simply write its event
    stream to <code>stdout</code> (standard output).
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Environment Handling:</strong> In development, the dev sees the
    stream in their terminal. In production, the execution environment captures
    these streams and routes them to a final destination, such as a log-indexing
    system like ELK or Splunk.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Introspection:</strong> Treating logs as a continuous stream allows
    for real-time analysis, alerting, and long-term storage without the app
    needing to manage log rotation or file permissions.
  </li>
</ul>
