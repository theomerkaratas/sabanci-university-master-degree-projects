<h1>Config</h1>

<p>
  An app's configuration is everything that is likely to vary between
  deployments (staging, production, developer environments).
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>The Environment Rule:</strong> Store configuration in environment
    variables. Unlike config files, environment variables are unlikely to be
    checked into code repos accidentally and are easy to change between
    different deploys without changing code.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>The Open Source Test:</strong> A great litmus test for whether your
    config is handled correctly is asking: "Could the codebase be made open
    source at this very moment without revealing any credentials?" If not, your
    config is improperly hardcoded.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Strict Separation:</strong> Config must be strictly separated from
    code. Code does not change between deploys, but config does. Grouping config
    into "environments" (like "development" vs "production") does not scale as
    well as managing individual environment variables.
  </li>
</ul>
