<h1>Admin Processes</h1>

<p>
  Run administrative or management tasks as one-off processes in the same
  environment as the regular app.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Environment Parity:</strong> One-off admin tasks (like database
    migrations or running a console to inspect data) should run against the same
    codebase and configuration as the long-running processes.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Tooling Integration:</strong> Use the same dependency isolation
    techniques (Factor II) for admin scripts as you do for the main app. This
    ensures that a migration script doesn't fail because of a missing library
    that the app itself uses.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Process Bundling:</strong> Twelve-factor languages usually provide a
    built-in REPL or a way to run scripts easily. These should be part of the
    deployment bundle so they can be executed seamlessly in any environment.
  </li>
</ul>
