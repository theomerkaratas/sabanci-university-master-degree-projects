<h1>Dev/Prod Parity</h1>

<p>
  Keep development, staging, and production as similar as possible to minimize
  friction and bugs.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>The Three Gaps:</strong> Traditionally, there are gaps in
    <strong>time</strong> (weeks between deploys),
    <strong>personnel</strong> (devs write code, ops deploy it), and
    <strong>tools</strong> (using SQLite locally but Postgres in prod). A
    twelve-factor app closes these gaps.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Tooling Consistency:</strong> Developers should use the same backing
    services in their local environment as are used in production. Using
    "lightweight" versions of databases locally often leads to subtle,
    hard-to-track bugs.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Continuous Deployment:</strong> By keeping environments identical,
    developers can feel confident deploying code minutes after it is written,
    leading to a faster and more agile development cycle.
  </li>
</ul>
