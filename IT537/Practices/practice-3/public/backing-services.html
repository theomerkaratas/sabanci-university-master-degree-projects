<h1>Backing Services</h1>

<p>
  Treat backing services—any service the app consumes over the network as part
  of its normal operation—as attached resources.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Resource Attachment:</strong> Whether it is a local MySQL database
    or a third-party API (like SendGrid or S3), the app should treat them all as
    "attached resources." They are accessed via a URL or credentials stored in
    the Config (Factor III).
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Interchangeability:</strong> You should be able to swap a local SMTP
    server for a third-party service without making any changes to the app's
    code. Only the configuration needs to change.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Loose Coupling:</strong> Resources can be attached to and detached
    from deploys at will. If a database is misbehaving, you should be able to
    spin up a new one from a backup and point the app to it seamlessly.
  </li>
</ul>
